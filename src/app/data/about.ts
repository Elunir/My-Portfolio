  description: `After completing my Diploma in Computer Science, I began working as a Graphic Designer.

  However, I soon realized that what I really wanted to do was work as Software Engineer, so I started learning from online seminars. During my studies, I learned to code HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ionic, Angular â€” all of which were essential to my eventual success as a Web Application Developer.
  
  Since then, I have been able to further expand my skills on my own and have learned React, React Native, Express, Redux, Mobx State Management, all in efforts to becoming a better Developer.
  
  My top priority is exceeding my biggest expectations and focusing on delivering a top-of-the-game app/website for my clients.`,
